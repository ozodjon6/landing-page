                  <h4 class="title">Main finding from research data</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Compliance department lacks the primary data that we receive from the application on the site. Their pain is that then each time you need to write an e-mail message to the client asking for additional data. Clients do not respond quickly or send incorrect documents. As a result, it takes time to open an account.</li>
                    <li>From start to account opening takes 10 days.</li>
                    <li>The account is opened in the UK. There is a regulator in the face of the FCA. He has a big requirement for those who want to open an account.</li>
                    <li>I saw a list of data that the regulator requires to open an account. Got a mild shock. There is a lot to ask.</li>
                    <li>Due to the fact that the form is easy and potential clients think that it is easy to open an account in the UK. About 60% of requests to open an account do not meet the requirement. It turns out that the compliance loses 60% of the time for processing applications that do not meet the requirements and are abandoned to users</li>

                    <li>Improve the registration form, thereby reducing the burden on compliance</li>
                    <li>Reduce the number of requests to the support team</li>
